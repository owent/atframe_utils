# Test Design and Acceptance

Read this reference when planning, writing, or reviewing unit/regression tests. Keep the work tied to this repository's
actual framework, contracts, fixtures, and commands; do not substitute generic testing theory.

## Establish evidence and risk

1. Locate the behavior source: the user requirement, public API, schema/configuration contract, current caller, or a
   reproduced defect. Inspect the production entry point, its material side effects, and the nearest healthy tests.
2. Define the system under test, what must work, what is most likely to fail, what has the highest impact, and which
   result/state/side effect is observable. Protect those risks first.
3. For every case, name the realistic production break it should catch — a bug, not a decision. If no observable bug
   would make it fail, remove it or redesign it; do not add tests for counts, trivial forwarding, static definitions, or
   deleted code. If only an intentional decision change (a constant's value, exact message wording, private layout)
   would fail the case, it is a change detector; test the observable behavior that depends on the decision instead.
4. If the scope, interface, field, environment, prerequisite, or root cause is not verified, record the assumption and
   risk gap. Do not invent missing details or claim the suite is complete beyond the evidence.

## Construct honest, minimal cases

- Start from a contract-valid baseline that traverses the intended production flow. Set only verified prerequisites and
  behavior-relevant data. Never add an internal flag, timestamp, delay, or unrelated field merely to steer the current
  implementation toward green.
- For an error case, change one documented precondition from the valid baseline. Assert the intended error category and
  material postconditions, including absence of writes, locks, leaks, or state changes when relevant; do not let an
  earlier unrelated failure satisfy the case.
- Prefer meaningful, non-default, distinguishable values so an empty/default implementation cannot pass accidentally.
  Cover normal flow and justified classes such as below/at/above a boundary, empty/missing/malformed input, partial
  failure, retry, idempotence, cancellation, rollback, and cleanup. Do not create a mechanical cross-product.
- Obtain the actual result through the real public entry point. Derive expected values independently with literals, a
  hand-checked fixture, or an independent oracle; never compute both sides with the code under test or copy its algorithm.
- Mirror the complete contract shape in fixture and vector data — every field the public struct or API documents, not
  only the fields the current assertion reads; a partial fixture passes while a downstream read breaks.
- Assert behavior, not text: run a tool or script against controlled inputs and assert outputs, exit codes, or side
  effects instead of grepping its source when it can be executed.
- Keep one coherent behavior per case, but assert all material outcomes. Reuse setup only when it hides irrelevant
  plumbing, not scenario inputs or expected results. Use a table only for genuinely equivalent input classes.
- Keep test-only cleanup/access helpers in test support instead of adding production API. If mock setup dominates the
  scenario or cannot preserve required side effects, use a real in-process component or integration coverage.

## Keep dependencies deterministic

- Exercise the real system under test. Prefer real dependencies only when fast and deterministic; isolate network, wall
  clock, randomness, external services, and thread scheduling with existing fakes, virtual clocks, event pumps, or
  explicit synchronization seams.
- Do not use a fixed sleep, CPU/network jitter, internal pump count, or arbitrary timeout as proof of correctness. For
  real I/O, wait on an observable predicate; a wall-clock timeout is only a hang guard and must be followed by an
  explicit assertion of the predicate and business result.
- Advance logical time through an existing clock seam. Use a reproducible seed when an existing API supports one;
  otherwise assert stable invariants instead of exact random output.
- Mock at the slow/external boundary only after inspecting relevant side effects. Assert calls/order/counts only when
  they are contract behavior; otherwise assert the SUT's output, state, payload, and cleanup. A mock or fake earns no
  assertions: its mere presence or invocation proves nothing about the SUT — assert the real component's observable
  result or unmock it.
- Treat real services, databases, and network environments as integration prerequisites. Pin and report them; an
  unavailable or skipped dependency is not passing unit coverage.

## Follow project conventions

- Use the nearest healthy tests for `CASE_TEST(group, case)` naming, fixture ownership, helper selection, CMake
  registration, and cleanup. New names should be lower_snake_case where the local group uses it and describe the
  scenario/result; do not mass-rename legacy cases.
- Use the smallest Arrange-Act-Assert path that exposes intent. Keep decisive inputs and expected outcomes visible in the
  case. Do not copy a nearby fragile sleep, fixed port, or implementation-shaped mock merely for consistency.
- `CASE_EXPECT_*` is non-fatal in the supported framework variants. After a failed setup/precondition assertion, guard
  dependent work or return after required cleanup; do not continue into invalid state.
- Apply `engineering-guidelines` for C++/CMake style and validation instead of duplicating those rules here.

## Repair discipline

- When a case fails, fix the implementation or redesign the case from evidence. Never weaken or delete an existing
  assertion, loosen an expected value, skip or disable a case, add a retry, or widen a timeout merely to reach green.
- A defect case that passes on first run proves nothing about the fix; observe the intended RED or report that it was
  not observed.
- After repeated failed fixes, stop and re-evaluate per `change-workflow` instead of stacking patches or reshaping the
  case to fit the current implementation.

## Accept with fresh evidence

- For defects and behavior changes, follow `change-workflow`: when practical, run the focused case before implementation
  and confirm it fails for the intended reason. If RED was not observed, say so rather than claiming it.
- Run the exact case/group first and confirm it was selected, then the affected target/suite and broader coverage in
  proportion to risk. Repetition or shuffling may diagnose leaked global state/concurrency; a retry-pass remains flaky.
- Mentally mutate high-risk behavior: wrong branch/argument, missing validation or side effect, default return, and
  omitted cleanup. A focused assertion should catch each realistic mutation the selected scope claims to protect.
- Reject or redesign a case when: setup and assertion share the same object or builder; it fails only via crash or
  timeout and never on a wrong value; it fails on intentional refactors but not on realistic bugs; it greps source text
  instead of executing the artifact; mock setup outweighs the scenario; or it exists only for a count.
- Read exit status and selected/passed/failed/skipped counts. Report source-derived conclusions, compilation, executed
  tests, skips, and unverified platforms/environments separately.
